All features for the initial release as outlined within the [roadmap](https://github.com/caffeinated/modules/wiki/Roadmap#10-beta) have been completed. I'm simply waiting until Laravel 5.0 is officially released to tag this as stable v1.0. In the meantime I will continue to clean up the code that currently stands.

To learn more about the usage of this package, please refer to the full set of [documentation](https://github.com/caffeinated/modules/wiki). You will find quick installation instructions below.

Installation
------------
Begin by installing the package through Composer. The best way to do this is through your terminal via Composer itself:

```
composer require caffeinated/modules
```

Once this operation is complete, simply add both the service provider and facade classes to your project's `config/app.php` file:

#### Service Provider
```
'Caffeinated\Modules\ModulesServiceProvider'
```

#### Facade
```
'Module' => 'Caffeinated\Modules\Facades\Module'
```

#### New Artisan Command
```
php artisan module:controller ModuleName ControllerName
```

And that's it! With your coffee in reach, start building out some awesome modules!
